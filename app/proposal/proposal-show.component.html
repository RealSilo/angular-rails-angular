      <p>Hi {{ proposal.customer }}</p>

      <p>It was a pleasure getting to meet with you and review your project requirements. I believe it is a great fit for the types of the applications that I build out. Please feel free to check out some of my past projects <a href="{{ proposal.portfolio_url }}" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <p>To successfully build out the application I will be utilizing {{ proposal.tools }} and a number of other tools to ensure that the projects follows industry wide best practices.</p>

      <p>Making sure that you are fully informed is one of my top priorities, so in addition to incorporating  everything that we discussed, I will also be creating a project management dashboard and sending you a project update message daily so that you can have a transparent view of the development as it takes place.</p>

      <p>To accomplish the project and meet the requirements that we discussed, I am estimating that it wil take {{ proposal.estimated_hours }} in development time to completed. The project should take {{ proposal.weeks_to_complete }} weeks to complete and with my hourly rate of ${{ proposal.hourly_rate }}/hour, the estimated total will be {{ proposal.hourly_rate * proposal.estimated_hours | currency:'USD':true:'.0' }}.</p>

      <p>The next step from here is to set up a meeting to finalize  the porject and sign the contracts.</p>

      <p>I am excited to working with you and build out this project.</p>
